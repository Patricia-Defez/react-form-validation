# React Form Validation

Use controlled components to implement a form (with validations) to add new "emails" to an email list.

1. Add email state to Form component, project the state to the input value and handle the onChange event to update the state

2. Add error state to the Form component, validate the input value in the onChange handler and set the error value.

3. Add touch state to Form component. handle the onBlur event to set it.

4. display errors/success messages, colors and icons based on the touch and error states.

5. handle the onSubmit event to add a new user (check props.addEmail). Don't forget the e.preventDefault().

Happy coding!!!! <3
